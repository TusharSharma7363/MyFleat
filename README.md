## Project Description:

The aim of this project is to develop a mobile application that allows users to manage a list of cars using a Room database and fetches car/make/model data from a government transportation API. The app will have login and logout functionality to ensure secure access to user data.

The main features of the application are as follows:

User Login and Logout: The app will allow users to securely log in and log out of their account. The user's login credentials will be stored in the Room database.

Fetching Car/Make/Model Data: The app will fetch the data of all cars/make/model from the government transportation API. The fetched data will be displayed in the form of a list.

Adding a New Car: The app will allow the user to add a new car to their list. The user will be able to select the make and model of the car from the fetched data. The user will also be able to upload an image of the car.

Viewing List of Cars: The app will display a list of all the cars added by the user on the dashboard. The user will be able to view the make, model, and image of each car in the list.

Editing and Deleting a Car: The user will be able to edit the make and model of the car, as well as the image. The user will also be able to delete a car from the list.

The app will use the Room database to store the user's login credentials and the list of cars. The fetched data from the government transportation API will be displayed in the app using RecyclerView. The app will also use Glide to load the images of the cars.

The app will be developed using Android Studio and the programming language used will be Java. The project will follow the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture pattern to ensure efficient and scalable code. The app will also implement best practices for handling network calls and database operations to ensure a smooth user experience.

Overall, this application will provide an easy-to-use platform for users to manage their cars with a secure and efficient database system.
